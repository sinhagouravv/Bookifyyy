We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard personal data against unauthorized access, misuse, loss, or disclosure.

                                User account credentials are handled with strict security standards. Passwords are securely encrypted using modern hashing techniques and are never stored in plain text. Access to administrative systems is restricted to authorized personnel only, and role-based access control mechanisms are used to ensure that users and staff can only access information relevant to their role. We also monitor login activity to detect and prevent suspicious or unauthorized access attempts.

We do not store full credit or debit card details on our servers. All payment transactions are encrypted and processed through trusted payment gateways to ensure financial data protection.

                                Our systems are regularly monitored and maintained to protect against potential threats such as malware, unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cyber risks. Security updates and patches are applied promptly to maintain platform integrity. In addition, we perform routine backups to ensure data availability and recovery in case of unexpected events.

                                While we take extensive measures to secure our platform, users also play an important role in maintaining account security. We encourage users to choose strong passwords, avoid sharing login credentials, and report any suspicious activity immediately. If a security vulnerability or issue is identified, users may contact us at <a href="mailto:bookifyyy@gmail.com" className="text-indigo-600 font-semibold">bookifyyy@gmail.com</a>, and we will investigate the matter promptly.

                            <p>

                            <p>
                                The User Dashboard serves as the central hub for account management. It provides a real-time overview of user activity and membership details. From the dashboard, users can:

                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                The dashboard also displays important updates such as renewal reminders, overdue warnings, and new feature announcements. It is designed to give users full visibility into their library engagement. Users can update personal information, upload profile images, and manage security settings from the dashboard interface.
                            </p>

                            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4">Book Catalog</h3>
                            <p>
                                The Book Catalog is the core of the Bookify platform. It provides a searchable and filterable database of available books. Users can search by Title, Author, Category, and Availability status.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Each book listing includes detailed information such as Book description, Author information, Number of available copies, Reviews and ratings, and Borrowing eligibility.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If a book is available, users may issue it instantly (subject to membership limits). If the book is currently unavailable, users may join a waitlist if enabled. The catalog is regularly maintained by moderators and administrators to ensure accuracy and quality of information.
                            </p>

                            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4">Issuing and Returning Books</h3>
                            <p>
                                When a user issues a book, the system automatically assigns a due date based on the user’s membership plan. The borrowing period may vary depending on subscription level or institutional rules. Users are responsible for returning books before the due date to avoid penalties. If a book is returned late, the system may calculate fines according to the configured fine policy. The system provides automated reminders before due dates and alerts in case of overdue books. Once returned, the book is added to the user’s reading history for future reference. Renewals may be available if the book is not reserved by another user.
                            </p>

                            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4">Payments and Membership</h3>

                                At Bookifyyy, we strive to provide a transparent and fair billing experience for all users. This Refund Policy explains the conditions under which refunds may be issued for membership plans, subscriptions, or other paid services offered through our platform. Membership and subscription fees paid to Bookify are generally non-refundable once the subscription period has begun. Users are encouraged to review plan details carefully before completing a purchase. However, refunds may be considered in cases of duplicate payments, accidental transactions, or technical errors that result in incorrect billing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If a user experiences a billing issue or believes they have been charged incorrectly, they must contact our support team within a reasonable time frame from the date of the transaction. Refund requests should include relevant details such as the transaction ID, payment date, and a brief explanation of the issue. Each request will be reviewed individually, and refunds may be granted at our discretion depending on the circumstances.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In cases where a membership is canceled before the renewal date, the cancellation will prevent future charges, but the current subscription period will remain active until it expires. Bookifyyy does not typically provide partial refunds for unused time within an active subscription period. Refunds, when approved, will be processed through the original payment method used at the time of purchase. The time required for the refund to reflect in the user’s account may vary depending on the payment provider and banking institution.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Fines paid for overdue books or penalties are generally non-refundable, except in cases where the charge was applied due to a verified system error. Bookifyyy reserves the right to modify this Refund Policy at any time. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised “Last Updated” date.
